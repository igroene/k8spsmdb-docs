# Scale Percona Server for MongoDB on Kubernetes and OpenShift

One of the great advantages brought by Kubernetes and the OpenShift platform is
the ease of an application scaling. Scaling a Deployment up or down ensures new
Pods are created and set to available Kubernetes nodes.

Scaling can be vertical and horizontal. Vertical scaling adds more compute or
storage resources to MongoDB nodes; horizontal scaling is about adding more
nodes to the cluster. [High availability](architecture.md#high-availability)
looks technically similar, because it also involves additional nodes, but the
reason is maintaining liveness of the system in case of server or network
failures.

## Vertical scaling

There are multiple components that Operator deploys and manages: MongoDB replica
set instances, mongos and config server instances, etc. To add or reduce CPU or
Memory you need to edit corresponding sections in the Custom Resource. We follow
the structure for requests and limits that Kubernetes [provides](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

To add more resources to your MongoDB replica set instances, edit the following
section in the Custom Resource:

```yaml
spec:
  replsets:
    resources:
      requests: 
        memory: 4G
        cpu: 2
      limits:
        memory: 4G
        cpu: 2
```

Use our reference documentation for the [Custom Resource options](operator.md#operator-custom-resource-options) 
for more details about other components.

## Horizontal scaling

The size of the cluster is controlled by the `size` key in the
[Custom Resource options](operator.md#operator-custom-resource-options)
configuration.

!!! note

    The Operator will not allow to scale Percona Server for MongoDB with the
    `kubectl scale statefulset <StatefulSet name>` command as it puts `size`
    configuration options out of sync.

You can change size separately for different components of your cluster by
setting this option in the appropriate subsections:

* [replsets.size](operator.md#replsets-size) allows to set the size of the
    MongoDB Replica Set,
* [replsets.arbiter.size](operator.md#replsets-arbiter-size) allows to set the
    number of [Replica Set Arbiter instances](arbiter.md#arbiter),
* [sharding.configsvrReplSet.size](operator.md#sharding-configsvrreplset-size)
    allows to set the number of [Config Server instances](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/),
* [sharding.mongos.size](operator.md#sharding-mongos-size) allows to set the
    number of [mongos](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/)
    instances.

For example, the following update in `deploy/cr.yaml` will set the size of the
MongoDB Replica Set to `5` nodes:

```yaml
....
replsets:
  ....
  size: 5
  ....
```

Donâ€™t forget to apply changes as usual, running the
`kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml` command.
