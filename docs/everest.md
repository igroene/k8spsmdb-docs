# Install Percona Server for MongoDB cluster using Everest

[Percona Everest :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/everest/) is an open source cloud-native database platform that helps developers deploy code faster, scale deployments rapidly, and reduce database administration overhead while regaining control over their data, database configuration, and DBaaS costs.

It automates day-one and day-two database operations for Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB databases within Kubernetes clusters.
Percona Everest will provide you web GUI and allow launching a database instance with just a few clicks, as well as scale it, do routine maintenance tasks, such as software updates and patch management, backups, and monitoring.

You can try it in action by [Installing Percona Everest :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/everest/quickstart-guide/qs-overview.html) and [managing your first cluster :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/everest/use/cluster-management.html).
